# Molmer-Sorensen-gate
The code is  for people(like myself) to understand how the famous two qubit gate evolves.
The purpose of the notebook is for my lab (https://www.quantumlah.org/research/group/Dzmitry) to fit the experiment result and fine tune the experiment parameter due to hardware or software limitation to achieve better gate perforence.

For the orgin proporsal of this quantum gate, please refer to origin paper for further detail(Phys.Rev.Lett. 82 (1999) 1971-1974), for our simulation and experiment reference in trapped ion system, please check this one (10.1103/PhysRevA.72.062316). 

Building a Quantum computing is quite fun lol.
